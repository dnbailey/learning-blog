The following is a paper I wrote for one of my education course. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about my strengths. The road to self-discovery is an important part of growing and learning. As I reflect on my own strengths, I can’t help but think about my students. I really look forward to discussing and learning with them about their strengths.

As leaders and educators, it is critical that we know ourselves and know the ones we lead. How often do we spend our time telling students how they need to improve their weaknesses? How little time do we devote to celebrate and fostering their strengths? The following explores my journey to discover my own strengths, and it begins my journey to encourage those I lead to do the same.

I’d highly recommend the StrengthsFinder 2.0 and George Couros’ new book Innovate Inside the Box.

Also this may seem a little stiff style-wise since it was written as an academic paper. Sorry if the tone is a bit too academic.

## StrengthsFinder Reflection

Gallup’s StrengthsFinder 2.0 is an incredible tool for developing an understanding of your strengths. After taking the survey, I gained many insights, and I have a clearer picture of the ways I can contribute my strengths as a leader and educator. We cannot just stop with understanding our strengths. We must examine the strengths of those we lead. I agree with what Couros and Novak (2019) said in Innovating Inside the Box:
Not to mention, we should not help develop the weaknesses of our students, but our focus should be on their strengths. When people feel valued, they are more likely to show up and tun in physically and mentally. (p. 41)

Too often in education, we spend our time and resources trying to cultivate weaknesses. After learning about my strengths, I cannot help but question this practice and imagine the possibilities if we were to shift our focus on strengths. Lopez and Louis (2009) suggest that educators who focus on strengths utilize teach strategies that reflect those strengths and focus on eliciting the acumens of their pupils. I understand now that I must use my endowments, but also equip my students to use their own.

### Findings

My top five Cliffton strengths were: learner, ideation, intellection, strategic, and achiever. Almost all of my strengths fall within the leadership domain of strategic thinking except the achiever strengths. My strengths compliment each other and seem to create synergistically flow to my work. While the assessment merely points us to distinct traits, I feel empowered to explore and grow my strengths.

#### Learner

Learner was my top strength. According to Rath (2017), this strength focuses on the process of learning. The content and the end product are not necessarily relevant. Rath proposes that for the learner, “The outcome of the learning is less significant than the ‘getting there’” (Rath, 2017, p. 133). The learner finds opportunities to learn quickly and to develop mastery to be exhilarating. Working on new initiatives that require research is a perfect fit for this strength. Furthermore, he suggests that teaching could be a good avenue for utilizing the learner strength.
Winseman (2018) reiterates Rath’s insights but goes further to posit that the learner may become “subject matter experts.” The thrill of learning something new is not limited to the surface level but may lead to an in-depth exploration of a topic. The drive to learn is a “primary motivator” and guides to natural openness to change. Rath (2019) suggests that the learner can be an impetus for innovation in an organization and can spark others to join in reform.

#### Ideation

Ideation is the strength focused on generating ideas. Rath (2019) defines an idea as a connection of seemingly disparate concepts. Many times this strength is seen by others as creativity or innovative thinking. People high in ideation tend to have unique perspectives or viewpoints on a topic. New ideas provide energy and excitement. Upon reflection, ideation is a trigger strength for me. It is usually the activator of my other assets, and it is where I begin all tasks, both personally and professionally.

#### Strategic

Strategic is a clarifying strength. According to Rath (2019), individuals high in strategic can “sort through the clutter and find the best route forward” (p. 165). Strategic individuals sort through ideas and select the best path forward. Additionally, Rath points out that individuals high in this strength recognize barriers early in the planning stage. They are quick to dismiss ideas that will be blocked.

#### Intellection

Intellection is all about thinking. Rath (2019) separates this from ideation and strategic thinking in that it focuses on being trapped in thought. Often the individual enjoys intellectual activity and introspection. Specifically, the reflection relates to practical circumstances and how to improve the situation. Other strengths and interests often predicate the topic of thought.

#### Achiever

The achiever strength is all about ambition. Rath (2019) suggests that individuals high in achiever strength will not be satisfied until they accomplish something useful each day. Achievers do not tend to experience burn out and find work pleasurable when it leads to finishing a task. Additionally, there is always ample energy to start new objectives. Rath describes achievers as “driven,” but need to have a sense of accomplishment or closure to their tasks.

Achiever was the only strength in my top five that did not fall within the strategic thinking domain of leadership, but there are many parallels to the strategic thinking strengths. The need to generate ideas and learn is complemented by the drive to accomplish tasks. This strength can often counter-balance with my other strengths because it drives me towards completing tasks and not just thinking about them.

### Discussion

After seeing the results of the survey, most of the strengths fell in the strategic thinking domain of leadership. The lack of dominance in the relationship building and influencing domains were not a surprise. These are often the areas I have to work the hardest. If I had been forced to identify my traits before the questionnaire, I would have picked the learner. It is something I have known about myself for a long time, and I continue to see it as a cornerstone of my identity. It is also what I consider to be my greatest strength in the classroom.

####In the Classroom

Winseman (2018) indicates that as a learner, I “love to learn — and [I] love to help others, which makes [me] a natural teacher.” Before I started my teaching career, I never felt fulfilled by my various jobs. I believe it was due to a lack of engagement in learning. While I continued to learn outside of work, it was not until I started teaching that I could both work and learn in the same space.

I see this strength in both the classroom and in leadership activities. Winseman (2018) suggests that learners should bring others with them on the journey. I believe this is why I enjoy teaching and leading. Learning something new can be lonely. In the classroom, I see opportunities to share this journey. By sharing the learning, I can avoid getting lost and recognize the potential impact of scholarship.

Couros and Novak (2019) in their discussion of being a master learner suggest that there are three fundamental things educators should be learning: “learning about our students, learning for our students, and learning from our students” (p. 77). The classroom and education are continually feeding my need to learn, and I believe that is why I enjoy my career so profoundly. My two strengths of learner and achiever mix in this space to make it vital for me to deepen and master being a learner and educator.

As a leader, I know that learning would be a key trait I would need to cultivate in others. Mikkelsen and Jarche (2015) summarize that “If work is learning and learning is the work, then leadership should be all about enabling learning.” I would need to be a lead learner as an administrator, or I do not think I would be satisfied with the job. While those I lead would not necessarily need to enjoy the depth or breadth of learning, I know that I would be essential to my success as a leader to focus on the learning.

#### Time to Think

One of the key takeaways from studying my strengths is that I need to allocate time to think and reflect. Many of my strengths share this common thread. All the strategic thinking strengths require time to think and process, and even the achiever demands time alone to work. Rath (2019) suggests that I should schedule a specific time for reading and thinking. Reflecting on times when I have been too busy to budget time to think, I know that I was dissatisfied and overwhelmed.

As a leader, I need to close my door and utilize time to think. Rath (2019) points out that it is essential to help colleagues understand that this time is not an affront to relationships but a necessity for me to process things. I do not currently utilize time alone enough to think and process. I need to begin budgeting this time in my schedule to remain engaged and productive.

#### Output Through Writing

Another critical insight from the strengths assessment is that writing is a meaningful output. Blogging seems like a vital tool for me to process my learning, feed my need for intellection, and clarify my ideas. It also satisfies the achiever’s drive to accomplish something. Rath (2017) suggests that intellection is served through writing as it allows for an amalgamation of thoughts. As someone firm in strategic thinking, I recognize that those thoughts often need to take form through a physical medium. Whether through creative output such a painting or other media, I have always needed to make physical representations of my ideas. In undergrad, I believe this is why I was initially attracted to becoming an art major. Creating art fulfilled complimented all my strengths and allowed me the space to learn and utilize my ideation. My career as a teacher and more recently, my involvement in technology highlights are extensions of my strengths.

As I reflect on my output as an educator, I see that writing is one place I fulfill my need to solidify my thoughts. Blogging feeds many of my strengths. As a learner, it provides a place to record what I have engaged with and the conclusions I have drawn. As an achiever, I feel a sense of accomplishment, finishing, and publishing a post. Blogging also fuels my intellection because it is often introspective and full of though. As a leader, I believe engaging in blogging provides me an opportunity to influence and engage others as learners strategically. By utilizing my strengths, I can help fill the gaps in my weaknesses.

#### Contributing to a Team

As someone competent in ideation, I see this as my most productive contribution to a team. In the Gallup (2019) vlog on ideation, Collison and Leibbrandt imply ideation is a powerful strength when starting something new with caveats. In the discussion, they suggest that I need to warn people before dumping my ideas. I can see this as I reflect on previous interactions. Surfing the wave of ideas that flow when starting something new is both fun and natural for me. As a leader, I must not get caught up in the thrill and temper my ideas with the needs of the team. Collison and Leibbrandt recommend asking permission from the group to ideate and respecting their wishes. Sometimes it is necessary to stop generating ideas and act.

#### Catalyst for Change

One of the most challenging results of the StrengthsFinder results was Rath’s (2017) implication that I have the potential to be a catalyst for change. I take to heart his challenge to “take this responsibility seriously” (p. 135). I believe this is the greatest strength I have to offer as an educator and leader. My strengths are uniquely geared to new initiatives and innovation. Change does not frighten me. Quite the opposite, I revel in it.

As I reflect on my experiences as an educator and leader, I see where I have utilized my strengths. I have been fortunate to receive the right challenges at the right time. In my career, I have rebuilt three programs and started two. I believe that I am uniquely positioned as an initiator, and as I begin examining my future as a leader, I look for ways to utilize those unique strengths.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, knowing your strengths is fundamentally more important than knowing your weaknesses. Seeking opportunities to capitalize on strengths leads to fulfillment and happiness. As I explore more opportunities for leadership, I believe it is important to weigh the impact my strengths can be utilized in these new opportunities. I will certainly evaluate how to leverage my strengths in all endeavors.
