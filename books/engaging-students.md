While I would consider much of this book to be common sense, I think we all know how uncommon "common sense" usually is. I think the thing I like the most about Schlecty is that he strips away all the fluff and gets to the heart of the matter. This book keeps students at the center and it is a good book for refocusing and reflection on practices.
